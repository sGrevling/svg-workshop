## Getting things running
- Clone this repo
- You need a reasonably recent version of `nodejs`. Version 16 reportedly works.
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro) is a useful tool for managing node versions, as is [google](https://google.com).
- run `npm i` or `yarn` in the root folder
- `[npm/yarn] run dev` in the same folder
- open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- try to have fun

## Structure
There are three main sections with corresponding packages in the `src` folder:
- `Tasks`
- `Workspaces`
- `Examples`

### What to do
Either play around and experiment, solve the tasks, or both.

There are two workspaces. 

One contains a scene for you to manipulate when solving the tasks and helping Bob on his quest to flee the burning rays of the sun / visit his friend Tom. 

The other is an emptyish void where you can create (absolutely) anything.
